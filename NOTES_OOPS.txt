administer> manager in the supermarket...manager work is to keep the customers happy.

Backend development:

ex: when we click on payment and pay the amount for an item in amazon, then a message is sent to a server which is a computer in amazon office...
    A computer which recieves messages via web when a client performs an action on the web is called the server.
   But computers can recieve messages from the internet by default. we have to program them to be able to recieve messages.
  To do that we need backend programming language like JAVA,NodeJS. However using backend programming language by default is very difficult as it requires huge amount of code.
  So there are two tools to help with this 
  1. backend framework(JAVA SPRING )
  2. pakage manager.(using code that other people have written for common tasks like doing calculations, talking to a database and setting up user login  )
